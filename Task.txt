MILESTONE PROJECT
You belong to a movie club and in school and as the only skilled web developer in your club, you volunteer to build a simple web page where your club can collect information about new members of the club. These are the action plans you have decided on

- Create a simple form on the web page that collects 
--- first name, 
--- surname, 
--- age, 
--- current level and 
--- favorite club
- Under the form, create a table that displays the records of saved users. The table should contain every collected information.
- The information collected from your form should be saved and updated in a JSON variable.
- Whenever a new record is added, clear the table and rebuild it using your JSON data
- Add a column with a button for deleting a user. Rebuild your table after the user is deleted
- For the MVP, data does not have to be persisted so it is fine if all the data gets cleared on page refresh.

- Tip: - Add a unique user identifier to each user. 
       - To make testing easier, try using a dummy JSON data to populate your table first.
